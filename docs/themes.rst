Theming
========

We have a very simple theme in Shonku and one can easily modify the theme.

The primary directory to keep in mind is *templates*. This is where all template
files are. If you make any changes to the templates remember to do a force build
of the site.

All static files required for the current theme are located in the *assests*
directory. You can add any static file there.

Secondary Themes
-----------------

We are slowing building a list of secondary themes. Most of these themes are following
Nikola themes only.

- `Shankoplast <http://kushal.fedorapeople.org/shonku_themes/shankoplast/>`_

You can `download <https://github.com/kushaldas/shonku_themes/archive/master.zip>`_
the latest version of these themes from github. Feel free to submit your own theme.
